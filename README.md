# python_examples
This repository is intended to contain some basic python code examples.

## color_translator.py
The color_translator function receives the name of a color, then prints its hexadecimal value.
Currently, it only supports the three additive primary colors (red, green, blue), so it returns "unknown" for all other colors.
