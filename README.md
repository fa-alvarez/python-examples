# python_examples

This repository is intended to contain some basic python code examples.  
AAll examples are based on code from Google's Crash Course on Python available
on Cousera's site as of today.

## color_translator.py

The color_translator function receives the name of a color, then prints its
hexadecimal value.  Currently, it only supports the three additive primary
colors (red, green, blue), so it returns "unknown" for all other colors.

## exam_grade.py

Students in a class receive their grades as Pass/Fail. Scores of 60 or more
(out of 100) mean that the grade is "Pass". For lower scores, the grade is
"Fail". In addition, scores above 95 (not included) are graded as "Top Score".
This function receives the score and returns the proper grade.
